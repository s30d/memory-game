## Instructions

* There are 8 pairs of cards on the game board.
* Once you click on a card, it will flip & show you its icon.
* When you click on another card & after that card flips:
* In case this card icon matches the one that was flipped earlier then both cards will turn green.
* In case both cards don't match then both cards will turn red then will be flipped on their back again.
* Every card you flip will be considered as a move & will be incremented in the counter you see above the game board.
* After 10 moves you will loose one star, after 20, you'll loose two stars.
* After you complete the game successfully , will display a success window will open showing how many moves you've done & how long have you spent time.
